### Requirements

The most important things to know about Lit in order to work with various
browsers and tools are that:

- Lit is published as ES2019.
- Lit uses "bare module specifiers" to import modules.
- Lit uses modern web APIs such as <template>, custom elements, shadow DOM,
    and ParentNode.

These features are supported by the latest versions of major browsers
(including Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Firefox) and most popular tools
(such as Rollup, Webpack, Babel, and Terser) with the exception of bare
module specifier support in browsers.
